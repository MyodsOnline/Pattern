# Learning project: *Architecture and Design Patterns in Python*
```
During the course, were studied the basics of:
```
## SOLID Principles:
1. **The Single-responsibility principle:** "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
2. **The Open–closed principle:** "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
3. **The Liskov substitution principle:** "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."
4. **The Interface segregation principle:** "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
5. **The Dependency inversion principle:** "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."

## Basics of Creational patterns:
1. abstract factory pattern
2. builder pattern
3. factory method pattern
4. prototype pattern
5. singleton pattern

## Basics of Structural patterns:
1. Adapter pattern
2. Bridge pattern
3. Composite pattern
4. Decorator pattern
5. Facade pattern
6. Proxy pattern

## Basics of Behavioral patterns:
1. Chain of responsibility pattern
2. Command pattern
3. Mediator pattern
4. Observer pattern
5. *etc.*
```
We used this knowledge to create our own project. 
Run the file run.py from the LocalProjectFinal directory to explore the project. 
You may also need to install libraries from the file requirements.txt.
